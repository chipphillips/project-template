## Data Analysis Workflow Example

Here's an example of how you might approach a data analysis task in the Constructiv AI project:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Load and preprocess data
df = pd.read_csv('construction_projects.csv')
df['start_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['start_date'])
df['end_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['end_date'])
df['project_duration'] = (df['end_date'] - df['start_date']).dt.days

# Feature engineering
df['season'] = df['start_date'].dt.quarter
df['project_size'] = pd.cut(df['budget'], bins=[0, 100000, 500000, 1000000, float('inf')], labels=['Small', 'Medium', 'Large', 'Very Large'])

# Split data into features and target
X = df[['budget', 'team_size', 'season', 'project_size']]
y = df['project_duration']

# One-hot encode categorical variables
X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=['season', 'project_size'])

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared Score: {r2}")

# Visualize feature importance
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'feature': X.columns, 'importance': model.feature_importances_})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(feature_importance['feature'], feature_importance['importance'])
plt.title('Feature Importance for Project Duration Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Features')
plt.ylabel('Importance')
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

This example demonstrates loading and preprocessing data, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. When working on these tasks, always consider the impact on user experience, business outcomes, and ethical implications of data use. Collaborate closely with other team members to ensure that your insights and models are effectively integrated into the Constructiv AI platform and provide tangible value to users and the business.
