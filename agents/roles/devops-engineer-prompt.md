        always {
            junit 'test-results/**/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
```

## Multi-Environment Setup

Implement a multi-environment setup using Terraform workspaces:

```hcl
# Create workspaces for different environments
resource "terraform_workspace" "environment" {
  name = var.environment
}

# Use workspace-specific variables
locals {
  env_config = {
    dev = {
      instance_type = "t3.micro"
      min_size      = 1
      max_size      = 3
    }
    staging = {
      instance_type = "t3.small"
      min_size      = 2
      max_size      = 5
    }
    prod = {
      instance_type = "t3.medium"
      min_size      = 3
      max_size      = 10
    }
  }
}

# Use the configuration in resources
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = local.env_config[terraform.workspace].instance_type
  # ... other configuration
}
```

## Container Registry Management

Set up and manage an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR):

```hcl
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "constructiv_ai" {
  name                 = "constructiv-ai"
  image_tag_mutability = "MUTABLE"

  image_scanning_configuration {
    scan_on_push = true
  }
}

# Add lifecycle policy to manage image retention
resource "aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy" "constructiv_ai_policy" {
  repository = aws_ecr_repository.constructiv_ai.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    rules = [{
      rulePriority = 1
      description  = "Keep last 10 images"
      selection = {
        tagStatus     = "any"
        countType     = "imageCountMoreThan"
        countNumber   = 10
      }
      action = {
        type = "expire"
      }
    }]
  })
}
```

## SSL/TLS Certificate Management

Implement SSL/TLS certificate management using AWS Certificate Manager:

```hcl
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "constructiv_ai" {
  domain_name       = "constructiv-ai.com"
  validation_method = "DNS"

  subject_alternative_names = [
    "www.constructiv-ai.com",
    "api.constructiv-ai.com"
  ]

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

# Validate the certificate
resource "aws_route53_record" "cert_validation" {
  for_each = {
    for dvo in aws_acm_certificate.constructiv_ai.domain_validation_options : dvo.domain_name => {
      name   = dvo.resource_record_name
      record = dvo.resource_record_value
      type   = dvo.resource_record_type
    }
  }

  allow_overwrite = true
  name            = each.value.name
  records         = [each.value.record]
  ttl             = 60
  type            = each.value.type
  zone_id         = aws_route53_zone.primary.zone_id
}

# Wait for certificate validation
resource "aws_acm_certificate_validation" "cert" {
  certificate_arn         = aws_acm_certificate.constructiv_ai.arn
  validation_record_fqdns = [for record in aws_route53_record.cert_validation : record.fqdn]
}
```

## Content Delivery Network (CDN) Setup

Set up Amazon CloudFront as a CDN for static assets:

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "constructiv_ai_cdn" {
  origin {
    domain_name = aws_s3_bucket.static_assets.bucket_regional_domain_name
    origin_id   = "S3-static-assets"

    s3_origin_config {
      origin_access_identity = aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity.oai.cloudfront_access_identity_path
    }
  }

  enabled             = true
  is_ipv6_enabled     = true
  default_root_object = "index.html"

  default_cache_behavior {
    allowed_methods  = ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"]
    cached_methods   = ["GET", "HEAD"]
    target_origin_id = "S3-static-assets"

    forwarded_values {
      query_string = false
      cookies {
        forward = "none"
      }
    }

    viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
    min_ttl                = 0
    default_ttl            = 3600
    max_ttl                = 86400
  }

  price_class = "PriceClass_100"

  restrictions {
    geo_restriction {
      restriction_type = "none"
    }
  }

  viewer_certificate {
    acm_certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate.constructiv_ai.arn
    ssl_support_method  = "sni-only"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = terraform.workspace
  }
}
```

## Additional Best Practices

1. Implement regular security audits and penetration testing.
2. Use AWS GuardDuty for continuous security monitoring and threat detection.
3. Implement AWS Config for resource inventory, configuration history, and change notifications.
4. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for managing configuration data and secrets.
5. Implement AWS CloudTrail for governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing.
