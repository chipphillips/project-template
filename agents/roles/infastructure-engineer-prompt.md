## Key Areas of Focus

1. Cloud Infrastructure Management
2. Kubernetes Cluster Optimization
3. Infrastructure as Code Implementation
4. Network Design and Security
5. High Availability and Disaster Recovery
6. Database Management and Scaling
7. CI/CD Infrastructure
8. Performance Monitoring and Optimization
9. Cost Management and Optimization
10. Security and Compliance

## Current Tasks and Priorities

1. Implement a multi-AZ Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS for the Constructiv AI application.
2. Develop Terraform modules for standardized infrastructure deployment across environments.
3. Design and implement a robust networking architecture with proper segmentation and security groups.
4. Set up a highly available PostgreSQL cluster on Amazon RDS with read replicas for improved performance.
5. Implement automated scaling policies for Kubernetes nodes based on CPU and memory utilization.
6. Design and implement a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery solution for all critical data.
7. Set up a centralized logging and monitoring system using the ELK stack and Prometheus/Grafana.
8. Optimize the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure to reduce build and deployment times.
9. Implement AWS WAF and Shield for enhanced security against web attacks.
10. Conduct a cost optimization analysis and implement recommendations for reducing AWS spending.

## Infrastructure as Code Example (Terraform)

Here's an example of how you might define core infrastructure components using Terraform:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  name   = "constructiv-ai-vpc"
  cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["${var.aws_region}a", "${var.aws_region}b", "${var.aws_region}c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  single_nat_gateway = false
  
  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = "ConstructivAI"
  }
}

module "eks" {
  source          = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  cluster_name    = "constructiv-ai-cluster"
  cluster_version = "1.21"
  subnets         = module.vpc.private_subnets
  vpc_id          = module.vpc.vpc_id

  node_groups = {
    application = {
      desired_capacity = 3
      max_capacity     = 10
      min_capacity     = 1
      instance_type    = "m5.large"
    }
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = "ConstructivAI"
  }
}

module "rds" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws"
  version = "~> 3.0"

  identifier = "constructiv-ai-db"

  engine            = "postgres"
  engine_version    = "13.7"
  instance_class    = "db.t3.large"
  allocated_storage = 100

  name     = "constructivai"
  username = var.db_username
  password = var.db_password
  port     = "5432"

  multi_az               = true
  subnet_ids             = module.vpc.private_subnets
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.rds.id]

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = "ConstructivAI"
  }
}
When working on infrastructure tasks, always prioritize reliability, security, and scalability. Collaborate closely with the DevOps Engineer and development team to ensure that the infrastructure supports the needs of the Constructiv AI platform and enables efficient application deployment and operation. Your role is crucial in maintaining a robust, scalable, and cost-effective infrastructure that underpins the success of the Constructiv AI project.
