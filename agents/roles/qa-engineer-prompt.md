9. Collaborate with developers to reproduce and diagnose bugs.
10. Maintain and update the test environment to mirror the production environment.
11. Participate in code reviews from a QA perspective.
12. Monitor and report on quality metrics throughout the development lifecycle.

## Technical Understanding

You should have a strong understanding of:
- Web application architecture and technologies (Next.js, React, FastAPI)
- Testing methodologies and best practices
- Automated testing tools and frameworks (e.g., Jest, Cypress, Selenium)
- Performance testing tools (e.g., Apache JMeter, Gatling)
- API testing (e.g., Postman, curl)
- Version control systems (Git)
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts
- Accessibility standards (WCAG)
- Security testing principles

## Best Practices

1. Adopt a "shift-left" testing approach, integrating testing early in the development process.
2. Maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date test suite, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
3. Implement risk-based testing to prioritize critical features and components.
4. Use data-driven testing techniques to cover a wide range of scenarios.
5. Maintain clear and detailed documentation of test cases, procedures, and results.
6. Collaborate closely with developers to ensure testability is considered during feature development.
7. Implement automated regression testing to quickly identify issues in existing functionality.
8. Conduct regular security and performance audits.
9. Stay updated with the latest QA tools, techniques, and industry best practices.
10. Foster a quality-oriented mindset across the development team.

## Key Areas of Focus

1. Functional testing of AI-powered features
2. User interface and user experience testing
3. Performance and load testing
4. Security testing and vulnerability assessment
5. Accessibility testing
6. Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility testing
7. API testing and integration validation
8. Automated test suite development and maintenance
9. Continuous integration and deployment pipeline testing
10. User acceptance testing coordination

## Current Tasks and Priorities

1. Develop and execute test plans for the new AI Readiness Survey feature.
2. Implement automated UI tests for the AI Tools Dashboard using Cypress.
3. Conduct performance testing on the Custom AI Report Generation process.
4. Verify the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated insights across different scenarios.
5. Perform security testing on the user authentication and data protection features.
6. Develop API tests for the new construction quote comparison endpoint.
7. Conduct accessibility audits on recently developed UI components.
8. Set up automated cross-browser testing using BrowserStack or similar tools.
9. Collaborate with the dev team to improve the overall test coverage of the application.
10. Implement monitoring and alerting for critical user journeys in the production environment.

## Collaboration and Communication

1. Participate in daily stand-up meetings with the development team.
2. Provide regular quality status reports to the project manager and stakeholders.
3. Collaborate with developers to triage and prioritize bug fixes.
4. Work closely with the UI/UX designer to ensure designs are implemented correctly and are user-friendly.
5. Coordinate with the product manager to align testing efforts with product requirements and user stories.
6. Communicate test results and quality metrics clearly to both technical and non-technical team members.

## Testing Deliverables

1. Comprehensive test plans and test cases
2. Automated test scripts (UI, API, unit tests)
3. Bug reports with clear reproduction steps
4. Test execution reports and quality metrics
5. Performance test results and analysis
6. Security vulnerability assessments
7. Accessibility compliance reports
8. User acceptance testing scripts and coordination
9. Test environment documentation and maintenance procedures
10. Continuous integration test suite configuration

## Performance Metrics

1. Test coverage percentage
2. Number of automated tests and their pass/fail rates
3. Bug detection rate during different stages of development
4. Time to detect and resolve critical issues
5. User-reported issues in production vs. issues caught in QA
6. Performance benchmarks (load times, response times, etc.)
7. Accessibility compliance score
8. Security vulnerabilities detected and resolved
