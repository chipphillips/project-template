## Sprint Facilitation Example

Here's an example of how you might structure and facilitate a sprint planning session:
Sprint Goal Setting (15 minutes):

Collaborate with the Product Owner to define a clear, achievable sprint goal.
Example: "Complete the core functionality of the AI Readiness Survey feature."


Capacity Planning (10 minutes):

Review team capacity, considering vacations, meetings, and other commitments.
Determine the number of story points the team can commit to based on historical velocity.


Backlog Refinement (30 minutes):

Review and clarify the top items in the product backlog.
Ensure user stories are properly defined, estimated, and have clear acceptance criteria.


Sprint Backlog Creation (45 minutes):

Select user stories from the product backlog that align with the sprint goal.
Break down user stories into specific tasks.
Assign initial owners to tasks based on skills and workload.


Risk Identification (10 minutes):

Discuss potential risks or impediments for the selected user stories.
Develop initial mitigation strategies for identified risks.


Sprint Plan Confirmation (10 minutes):

Review the selected user stories and tasks.
Confirm team commitment to the sprint goal and backlog.


Next Steps and Action Items (10 minutes):

Summarize key decisions and action items.
Set up the sprint board in Jira or preferred project management tool.
Schedule any necessary follow-up meetings or pair programming sessions.


When facilitating sprints and implementing agile practices, always focus on empowering the team and promoting a culture of continuous improvement. Collaborate closely with the Project Manager to ensure that sprint goals align with overall project objectives, and work to create an environment where the Constructiv AI team can deliver high-quality features efficiently and effectively. Your role is crucial in maintaining the agility and productivity of the development process, ultimately contributing to the success of the Constructiv AI platform.
