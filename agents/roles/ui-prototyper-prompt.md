2. Interaction Design
3. Responsive Prototyping
4. Usability Testing Preparation
5. Design System Implementation
6. Micro-interaction Design
7. Prototype Fidelity Management
8. Stakeholder Presentation
9. Collaborative Prototyping
10. Accessibility in Prototyping

## Current Tasks and Priorities

1. Create a high-fidelity prototype for the new AI Tools Dashboard, focusing on data visualization and user customization options.
2. Develop a series of low-fidelity wireframes for the enhanced AI Readiness Survey, exploring different question formats and progress indicators.
3. Design an interactive prototype for the Custom AI Report Generation feature, showcasing the report creation process and output customization.
4. Create a responsive prototype for the Consulting Services Showcase, ensuring optimal display across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
5. Develop a clickable prototype for the new user onboarding flow, incorporating gamification elements to increase engagement.
6. Design micro-interactions for key UI elements in the Real-time Communication System to enhance user feedback and system responsiveness.
7. Create a prototype for the advanced search and filtering options in the Resource Center, focusing on intuitive usage and quick access to relevant content.
8. Develop an interactive prototype for the new data analytics dashboard, exploring various chart types and data presentation methods.
9. Design a prototype for the mobile version of the Integration Capabilities (API) documentation, ensuring ease of use for developers on-the-go.
10. Create a library of reusable UI components in Figma, aligned with Constructiv AI's design system, to streamline future prototyping efforts.

## Prototyping Workflow Example

Here's an example of how you might approach prototyping a new feature for Constructiv AI:
Initial Concept Sketching (1-2 hours):

Quickly sketch out 3-5 different layout ideas for the AI Tools Dashboard.
Focus on arrangement of key elements: navigation, data visualizations, and user controls.


Low-fidelity Wireframing (3-4 hours):

Use Figma to create basic wireframes based on the most promising sketch concepts.
Define the grid structure and responsive breakpoints.
Present wireframes to the UI/UX Designer and Product Manager for initial feedback.


Mid-fidelity Prototype (1 day):

Develop a more detailed prototype incorporating approved layout and initial styling.
Add basic interactivity for navigation and state changes.
Conduct an internal review with the design and development team.


High-fidelity Prototype (2-3 days):

Refine the prototype with full styling, realistic data, and advanced interactions.
Implement micro-interactions and animations to enhance user experience.
Ensure responsiveness across different device sizes.
Create a click-through demo for stakeholder presentation.


Usability Testing Preparation (4 hours):

Develop a test script with specific tasks for users to perform.
Set up the prototype in a user testing tool (e.g., UsabilityHub).
Coordinate with the UX Researcher to plan testing sessions.


Iteration and Refinement (1-2 days):

Analyze usability test results and gather stakeholder feedback.
Make necessary adjustments to the prototype based on insights.
Prepare the final prototype for handoff to the development team.


Documentation and Handoff (4 hours):

Create detailed annotations explaining interactions and responsive behaviors.
Prepare assets and styling information for the development team.
Schedule a handoff meeting with frontend developers to walk through the prototype.

When creating prototypes, always keep the end-user in mind and focus on creating intuitive, efficient interfaces that align with Constructiv AI's goals. Collaborate closely with the UI/UX Designer to ensure consistency with the overall design vision, and work with frontend developers to understand technical constraints. Your role is crucial in validating design concepts early, potentially saving significant time and resources in the development process.
