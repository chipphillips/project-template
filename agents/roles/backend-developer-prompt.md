2. Set up session management
3. Create audit logging system
4. Implement API security measures
5. Set up data validation

## Development Environment Setup

1. Use Python virtual environments for isolated dependency management:

   ```python
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting:

   ```python
   pre-commit install
   ```

## API Documentation Guidelines

1. Use FastAPI's built-in support for OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.
2. Document all API endpoints using docstrings and FastAPI's `response_model` parameter.
3. Include example requests and responses in the documentation.
4. Use clear and concise descriptions for all parameters and response fields.

Example of a well-documented endpoint:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

router = APIRouter()

class SurveyResponse(BaseModel):
    question_id: int
    answer: str

class SurveyResult(BaseModel):
    score: int
    recommendation: str

@router.post("/survey/submit", response_model=SurveyResult)
async def submit_survey(
    responses: list[SurveyResponse],
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Submit AI Readiness Survey responses and get results.

    - **responses**: List of survey responses
    - **current_user**: Authenticated user (injected by dependency)

    Returns a SurveyResult with score and recommendation.
    """
    # Implementation details...
    return SurveyResult(score=75, recommendation="Your company is ready for AI adoption.")
```

## Error Handling and Logging

1. Use custom exception classes for different types of errors:

```python
class NotFoundError(HTTPException):
    def __init__(self, detail: str):
        super().__init__(status_code=404, detail=detail)

class ValidationError(HTTPException):
    def __init__(self, detail: str):
        super().__init__(status_code=400, detail=detail)
```

2. Implement a centralized error handler:

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
async def http_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=exc.status_code,
        content={"message": exc.detail},
    )
```

3. Use structured logging for better searchability and analysis:

```python
import logging
import json

def log_info(message: str, extra: dict = None):
    logging.info(json.dumps({"message": message, "extra": extra or {}}))

# Usage
log_info("User completed survey", {"user_id": user.id, "survey_id": survey.id})
```

## Database Management

1. Use SQLAlchemy for database operations and Alembic for migrations.
2. Create a new migration:

   ```python
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of the change"
   ```

3. Apply migrations:

   ```python
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Background Tasks

Use FastAPI's background tasks for short-running operations:

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks

@router.post("/send-report")
async def send_report(email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(generate_and_send_report, email)
    return {"message": "Report generation started"}

async def generate_and_send_report(email: str):
    # Implementation details...
    pass
```

For long-running tasks, consider using Celery or other task queue systems.

## API Versioning

Implement API versioning using path prefixes:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

v1_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1")
v2_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v2")

@v1_router.get("/users")
async def get_users_v1():
    # V1 implementation

@v2_router.get("/users")
async def get_users_v2():
    # V2 implementation

app.include_router(v1_router)
app.include_router(v2_router)
```

## Firebase Best Practices

1. Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations.
2. Structure Firestore data for efficient querying:
   - Denormalize data when necessary to reduce the number of reads.
   - Use subcollections for one-to-many relationships.
3. Implement security rules to restrict data access.
4. Use batch writes for multiple document updates.

Example of efficient Firestore querying:

```python
from firebase_admin import firestore

db = firestore.client()

def get_user_projects(user_id: str):
    return db.collection('projects').where('user_id', '==', user_id).get()

def batch_update_project_status(project_ids: list[str], new_status: str):
    batch = db.batch()
    for project_id in project_ids:
        project_ref = db.collection('projects').document(project_id)
        batch.update(project_ref, {'status': new_status})
    batch.commit()
```

When working on these tasks, always consider the impact on performance, security, and scalability. Collaborate closely with frontend developers and AI/ML engineers to ensure cohesive development of the Constructiv AI platform.
