```jsx
import Head from 'next/head'
import { NextSeo } from 'next-seo'

export default function AIReadinessSurvey() {
  const pageTitle = "AI Readiness Survey for Construction | Constructiv AI"
  const pageDescription = "Assess your construction company's AI readiness with our comprehensive survey. Get tailored recommendations to enhance your operations with AI."
  const canonicalUrl = "https://constructivai.com/ai-readiness-survey"

  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <link rel="canonical" href={canonicalUrl} />
      </Head>
      <NextSeo
        title={pageTitle}
        description={pageDescription}
        canonical={canonicalUrl}
        openGraph={{
          url: canonicalUrl,
          title: pageTitle,
          description: pageDescription,
          images: [
            {
              url: 'https://constructivai.com/images/ai-readiness-survey-og.jpg',
              width: 1200,
              height: 630,
              alt: 'AI Readiness Survey',
            },
          ],
          site_name: 'Constructiv AI',
        }}
        twitter={{
          handle: '@ConstructivAI',
          site: '@ConstructivAI',
          cardType: 'summary_large_image',
        }}
      />
      <main>
        <h1>AI Readiness Survey for Construction Companies</h1>
