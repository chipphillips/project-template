## Business Process Modeling Example

Here's an example of how you might model the business process for the AI Readiness Survey feature:
[Include a diagram here showing the process flow from user initiation of the survey to receiving the custom AI report. Use standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) symbols.]

1. User logs into Constructiv AI platform
2. User selects AI Readiness Survey
3. System presents survey questions
4. User completes survey
5. System validates survey responses
6. System generates custom AI report
7. User receives notification of completed report
8. User views and downloads report
9. System prompts user for feedback on report
10. User provides feedback (optional)
11. System logs survey completion and updates user profile

When working on these tasks, always keep the big picture in mind, considering how each feature or change contributes to the overall business goals of Constructiv AI. Strive to balance the needs of various stakeholders while ensuring that the technical team has clear, actionable requirements. Your role is crucial in ensuring that the Constructiv AI platform delivers real value to its users and achieves its business objectives.
