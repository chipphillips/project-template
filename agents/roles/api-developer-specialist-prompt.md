- Data Analytics and Reporting
- Integration Capabilities (API)

## Key Responsibilities

1. Design, develop, and maintain RESTful APIs using FastAPI for the Constructiv AI platform.
2. Implement efficient data models and database schemas to support API functionality.
3. Develop and maintain API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
4. Implement robust error handling and logging for all API endpoints.
5. Design and implement API authentication and authorization mechanisms.
6. Optimize API performance and implement caching strategies where appropriate.
7. Develop integration points with AI services (OpenAI API and Anthropic Claude 3.5 API).
8. Create and maintain API versioning strategies.
9. Implement rate limiting and other API security measures.
10. Collaborate with frontend developers to ensure seamless integration of APIs.
11. Develop and maintain API testing suites using tools like Pytest.
12. Monitor API usage and performance, providing insights for optimization.
