- Security considerations throughout the flow"

## 2. Data Architecture Deep Dive

"Help me design the data architecture for [feature/component], considering:

- Entity relationships and their cardinality
- Required indexes for optimal query performance
- Caching strategy at different layers
- Data validation rules and constraints
- Migration strategy for future schema changes
- Backup and recovery procedures"

## 3. API Design Review

"Review my API design for [specific service], focusing on:

- RESTful resource naming and hierarchy
- Request/response payload structures
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Rate limiting and throttling strategies
- API versioning approach
- Documentation standards
- Error handling patterns"

## 4. Frontend State Management

"Analyze the state management requirements for [feature], addressing:

- Global vs local state separation
- Real-time update handling
- Offline capabilities and sync
- Performance optimization strategies
- State persistence requirements
- Cross-component communication patterns"

## 5. Security Architecture Assessment

"Evaluate the security architecture for [component/system], considering:

- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization matrix
- Data encryption requirements (at rest and in transit)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Session management
- Audit logging requirements
- Security testing approach"

## 6. Performance Optimization Strategy

"Design a performance optimization strategy for [feature/system], including:

- Load time targets
- Resource optimization techniques
- Caching strategies
- Database query optimization
- Network request optimization
- Monitoring and metrics collection
- Performance testing methodology"

## 7. Infrastructure Design

"Help me architect the infrastructure for [system/component], addressing:

- Scalability requirements
- High availability needs
- Disaster recovery strategy
- Environment separation
- Monitoring and alerting
- Cost optimization
- Deployment automation"

## 8. Integration Architecture

"Design the integration architecture for [external system/service], considering:

- Integration patterns and protocols
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Data transformation requirements
- SLA requirements
- Monitoring and logging
- Fallback mechanisms
- Testing strategy"

## 9. Testing Strategy Development

"Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for [feature/system], including:

- Unit testing approach
- Integration testing requirements
- End-to-end testing scenarios
- Performance testing methodology
- Security testing requirements
- Test data management
- Continuous integration practices"

## 10. Maintenance and Operations

"Design the maintenance and operations strategy for [system], addressing:

- Monitoring requirements
- Alerting thresholds
- Backup procedures
- Update/upgrade processes
- Incident response procedures
- Documentation requirements
- Support workflow

## Using These Prompts

Each prompt should be customized for your specific project needs. When using these prompts:

1. Replace [bracketed text] with your specific feature or component
2. Add any project-specific constraints or requirements
3. Consider dependencies with other systems or components
4. Document assumptions and decisions made during the design process
5. Validate designs against non-functional requirements
6. Review and iterate based on feedback

Remember that these prompts are starting points for deeper discussions and should be adapted based on your project's unique requirements and constraints.
