## Installation and Configuration

### Current Setup

- Git version: 2.47.1.windows.1
- Installation path: C:\Program Files\Git
- SSH: External OpenSSH
- HTTPS: OpenSSL library

### Configuration Settings

```bash
# Performance Optimizations
core.preloadindex=true    # Speeds up git status by preloading index
core.fscache=true        # Speeds up git status by caching file system data
gc.auto=256             # Auto garbage collection after 256 loose objects
core.bigFileThreshold=50m # Optimizes handling of files larger than 50MB
pack.windowMemory=100m   # Memory limit for pack window during git gc

# Other Important Settings
core.autocrlf=true      # Windows line ending handling
core.symlinks=true      # Symbolic links support
pull.rebase=false       # Default merge strategy for pull
init.defaultbranch=main # Default branch name for new repositories
```

## Understanding Our Setup

### Key Components

1. **External OpenSSH**
   - Used for secure repository access
   - Supports remote development environments
   - Compatible with services like GitHub, GitLab

2. **OpenSSL Library**
   - Handles encryption and security
   - Manages certificates
   - Provides cryptographic functions

### Why These Choices?

- OpenSSH/OpenSSL combination optimized for:
  - Remote development
  - Cloud IDE integration
  - Cross-platform compatibility
