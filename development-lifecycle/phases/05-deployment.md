# Phase 5: Deployment

## Phase Overview

This phase covers the process of deploying the application to production and setting up monitoring systems.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Quality Assurance](04-quality-assurance.md)
- Production environment access
- Required credentials and secrets
- Deployment infrastructure ready

## Steps

### 1. Environment Preparation

Reference Integration & Configuration patterns:

- Production environment setup
- Database migration plan
- SSL certificate configuration
- Domain configuration
- Load balancer setup
- CDN configuration

**Deliverable:** Production environment documentation

### 2. Deployment Process

Follow CLI & Tooling patterns:

- Build optimization
- Asset compilation
- Database migrations
- Environment variable configuration
- Service deployment
- AI model deployment

**Deliverable:** Deployment procedure documentation

### 3. Monitoring Setup

Implement monitoring systems:

- Application monitoring
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- AI service monitoring
- Database monitoring
- Security monitoring

**Deliverable:** Monitoring system documentation

### 4. Verification

Verify deployment success:

- Smoke tests
- Integration tests
- Security scans
- Performance tests
- AI functionality tests
- Database verification

**Deliverable:** Deployment verification report

### 5. Documentation

Update/Create:

- Deployment guides
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring guides
- Incident response procedures
- Maintenance procedures
- Backup procedures

**Deliverable:** Production documentation

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All services deployed successfully
- [ ] Monitoring systems active
- [ ] SSL/TLS configured properly
- [ ] Database migrations successful
- [ ] Backup systems configured
- [ ] Security measures in place

## Next Steps

1. Monitor initial production usage
2. Gather performance metrics
3. Proceed to [Maintenance](06-maintenance.md)

## For AI Agents

When implementing this phase:

1. Use deployment-specific prompt patterns
2. Follow security best practices
3. Document all configuration steps
4. Create automated deployment scripts
5. Verify all monitoring systems
