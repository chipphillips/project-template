# Phase 3: Feature Development

## Phase Overview

This phase covers the process of implementing individual features, following a consistent pattern for both standard web features and AI-powered functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Development Setup](02-development-setup.md)
- Feature specifications from technical design
- Required APIs and integrations are available

## Steps

### 1. Feature Planning

Use [Project Design Prompts](../../guides/project-design-promts.md):

- User Journey Mapping
- Frontend State Management
- Data Architecture Review

**Deliverable:** Feature implementation plan using [Task Template](../../templates/task-template.md)

### 2. Implementation

Follow patterns from [Prompt Patterns](../../guides/prompt-patterns.md):

#### Standard Features

- Component Development
- API Route Implementation
- Database Integration
- State Management
- Error Handling

#### AI Features

- Model Integration
- Prompt Engineering
- Response Processing
- Error Handling
- Performance Optimization

**Deliverable:** Implemented feature with documentation

### 3. Testing

Reference Testing & Quality Assurance section:

- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- E2E Tests
- AI Response Testing
- Performance Testing

**Deliverable:** Test suite and results

### 4. Documentation

Create/Update:

- API Documentation
- Component Documentation
- Usage Examples
- AI Prompt Documentation
- Integration Guide

**Deliverable:** Feature documentation

## Quality Checklist
