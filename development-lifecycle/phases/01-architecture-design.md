# Phase 1: Architecture Design

## Phase Overview

This phase focuses on designing the technical architecture for your AI-powered web application.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Project Charter](../../templates/project-charter.md)
- Initial requirements gathering
- Stakeholder sign-off on project scope

## Steps

### 1. System Architecture Design

Use the following prompts from [Project Design Prompts](../../guides/project-design-promts.md):

- Data Architecture Deep Dive
- API Design Review
- Infrastructure Design

**Deliverable:** Technical architecture document using [Technical Specification Template](../../templates/tech-spec.md)

### 2. AI Feature Planning

Reference [Prompt Patterns](../../guides/prompt-patterns.md) for:

- AI integration architecture
- Model selection and implementation
- Data flow design
- Performance considerations

**Deliverable:** AI integration specification document

### 3. Database Schema Design

Follow the data modeling patterns from [Prompt Patterns](../../guides/prompt-patterns.md):

- Entity relationship design
- Schema optimization
- Migration strategy
- Backup and recovery plan

**Deliverable:** Database schema document

### 4. API Design

Use the API design patterns to define:

- Endpoint structure
- Authentication/Authorization
- Rate limiting
- Error handling
- Documentation standards

**Deliverable:** API specification document

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Architecture supports scalability requirements
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed
- [ ] Performance requirements are met
- [ ] AI integration points are clearly defined
- [ ] Database design is optimized
- [ ] API design follows REST best practices

## Next Steps

1. Review architecture with stakeholders
2. Update project documentation
3. Proceed to [Development Setup](02-development-setup.md)

## For AI Agents

When implementing this phase:

1. Use the specified prompt patterns for each component
2. Document all decisions and rationale
3. Generate complete technical specifications
4. Create visual diagrams where helpful
5. Update cross-referenced documentation
