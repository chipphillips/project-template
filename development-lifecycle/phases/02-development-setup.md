# Phase 2: Development Setup

## Phase Overview

This phase establishes the development environment and project structure, setting up all necessary tools and configurations.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Architecture Design](01-architecture-design.md)
- Approved technical specifications
- Access to required resources and tools

## Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

Reference [Prompt Patterns](../../guides/prompt-patterns.md) Integration & Configuration section:

- Node.js and package manager setup
- Database tools installation
- AI development tools configuration
- IDE setup and extensions

**Deliverable:** Development environment documentation

### 2. Project Structure Creation

Follow the structure from [Web App Guide](../../guides/web-app-guide.md):

```text
app/
├── (auth)/
├── (dashboard)/
├── api/
├── layout.tsx
components/
├── ui/
├── forms/
└── shared/
lib/
├── utils/
├── ai/
└── hooks/
```

**Deliverable:** Project skeleton with documentation

### 3. Base Configuration

Use configuration patterns from prompt-patterns.md:

- Environment variables setup
- TypeScript configuration
- ESLint and Prettier setup
- Git hooks and workflows
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

**Deliverable:** Configuration files and documentation

### 4. Development Tooling

Set up development tools:

- Testing framework
- Build tools
- Debug configuration
- Development database
- Local AI model setup (if applicable)

**Deliverable:** Development tools documentation

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All required tools are installed and configured
- [ ] Project structure follows best practices
- [ ] Configuration files are properly set up
- [ ] Development database is configured
- [ ] Git workflows are established
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is configured
- [ ] Local development environment is tested

## Next Steps

1. Verify all tools and configurations work
2. Test the development workflow
3. Proceed to [Feature Development](03-feature-development.md)

## For AI Agents

When implementing this phase:

1. Use CLI & Tooling patterns from prompt-patterns.md
2. Follow exact project structure specifications
3. Document all configuration decisions
4. Create setup scripts where possible
5. Verify all tools are compatible
