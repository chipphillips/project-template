# Phase 4: Quality Assurance

## Phase Overview

This phase ensures the quality, performance, and security of implemented features through comprehensive testing and review processes.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Feature Development](03-feature-development.md)
- Test suites are in place
- Monitoring tools are configured

## Steps

### 1. Code Review

Follow Code Reviews & Best Practices from [Prompt Patterns](../../guides/prompt-patterns.md):

- Code quality assessment
- Performance review
- Security audit
- Best practices verification
- AI implementation review

**Deliverable:** Code review report

### 2. Testing Verification

Reference Testing & Quality Assurance patterns:

- Run all test suites
- Verify test coverage
- Performance testing
- Load testing
- AI response testing
- Security testing

**Deliverable:** Test results and analysis

### 3. Performance Optimization

Use Performance Optimization patterns:

- Frontend optimization
- API response times
- Database query optimization
- AI response optimization
- Caching implementation
- Resource usage analysis

**Deliverable:** Performance report and optimizations

### 4. Security Assessment

Verify security measures:

- Authentication flows
- Authorization rules
- Data protection
- API security
- AI input/output validation
- Dependency vulnerabilities

**Deliverable:** Security audit report

### 5. Documentation Review

Ensure documentation completeness:

- API documentation
- Component documentation
- Integration guides
- AI feature documentation
- Deployment guides
- Troubleshooting guides

**Deliverable:** Documentation completeness report
